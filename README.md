Features:
Bind Game Event: Sets up a game event that triggers the display update.
Send Heartbeat: Ensures continuous communication with the SteelSeries Engine.
Display Time: Updates the display with the current date and time.
Usage:
Make sure you have SteelSeries Engine 3 installed.
Checking the corePropsPath variable for the communication address in the Python script.
Run the script, and it will continuously update the display with the current date and time.
Feel free to customize the code or adapt it for other purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
